            </h1>
            <p class="para-odd">
                The idea of the Mughal Garden was really an idea transported by Babur (the first Mughal Emperor) from
                the Timurid civilisation of Central Asia. When Babur invaded India, he brought with him the idea of the
                Timurid garden, which he adapted to the landscape of India, making it the Indo-Islamic (or Mughal)
                garden. A Mughal Garden consists of a Charbagh (a rectangular plot of land in a symmetrical pattern,
                quartered by waterways), and an irrigation system made using gravity and abshars (water chutes), inlaid
                with chevrons. It has terraces and flowerbeds of different heights, based on which plants they enclose.
                The Khayabans (paved walkways) are raised above the flowerbeds and are connected by causeways. This
                would lead up to a building, of which only the white dome was meant to be visible above the different
                layers of foliage. The water would occasionally flood, keeping the trees large in order to protect the
                rest of the garden from the sun.
            </p>
            <p class="para-even">
                Islamic culture regards paradise as a garden, and Muslims wanted to be buried inside gardens because it
                would amount to a material anticipation of immaterial bliss. The Mughal rulers were buried in mausoleums
                surrounded by gardens in order to come as close as possible to reach that level of paradise. In short,
                the funerary garden was Islam’s peaceful answer to death. The gardens themselves were said to work on
                two planes: as a living carpet and protection from the oppressive Sun, and sensually, as a place of
                shade, intimacy, and cool repose. The order of the gardens was the Mughals’ answer to the unruly,
                disorganised landscape around them and the water was there to contrast, with its fluid, calming motion.
            </p>
            <p class="para-odd">

                Most Mughal Gardens have disappeared through the centuries, for the simple reason that they require a
                prohibitive amount of water to maintain. Some of the only proper remaining ones are Jahangir’s funerary
                garden in Lahore and Babur’s Garden in Agra. Mughal Gardens used to surround both the Taj Mahal and
                Humayun’s tomb too, but after centuries of unruly disrepair, Lord Curzon trimmed the hedges to clean
                them up and more suit the English style of a garden.

                Mughal gardens were either built as funerary gardens or pleasure gardens, and the Shalimar Garden in
                Delhi is a small example of a once grand pleasure garden.

                In 1653, Izz-un-Nissa (also known as Akrabarabadi Mahal), a wife of Shah Jahan, laid the foundations of
                the Shalimar Bagh near Shahjahanabad (Old Delhi). Later, it was the venue for the coronation of Emperor
                Aurangzeb and was Sir David Ochterlony’s summer residence. Most of the garden is in disrepair, but the
                sheesh mahal (crystal palace) and central pavilion still stand today.

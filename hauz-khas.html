            </h1>
            <p class="para-odd">
                The Hauz Khas Fort (sometimes referred to as Hauz Khas complex) is part of Siri, the second city of
                Delhi, established by the Allauddin Khalji dynasty (1296–1316) in the 13th century. Allauddin Khalji
                built Siri, a walled city to protect it from invading Mongol raiders. Khalji continued to live in Lalkot
                (the first city of Delhi) so Siri remained largely a military garrison though several beautiful
                structures came up with time.

                An exploration of Siri begins in Hauz Khas, an urban village against the backdrop of monuments that are
                about 700 years old. The Hauz Khas complex houses a reservoir, a madrasa, mosque and several tombs. The
                main monuments are Bagh-I-Alam Ka Gumbad, Tefe Wala Gumbad, Kali Gumti, Tomb of Firoz Shah Tughlaq and
                Nili Masjid at Hauz Khasare.

            </p>
            <p class="para-even">
                Hauz Khas meaning ‘royal tank’ refers to the large water tank or reservoir built to supply water to the
                city of Siri and the Siri fort. It was originally known as Hauz-i-Alai after Khalji. The third ruler of
                the Tughlaq dynasty, Firoz Shah (1351–88) re–excavated the silted tank and cleared the clogged inlet
                channels.
                Firoz Shah’s Tomb: Sultan Firoz Shah built his tomb in the 1350s though he died nearly 40 years later in
                1388 at the age of 90. The Tughlaq period structure is made with grey quartzite and is adorned with
                intricate carvings and engravings. The main tomb structure is a square chamber with an octagonal central
                chamber inside. The cenotaph of Firoz Shah Tughlaq is at the centre and the dome atop the structure has
                an eight-point star. The inscription at the entrance states that repairs were carried out in 1508 on the
                instructions of Sikandar Lodi. The structure also houses graves of Nasiruddin Tughlaq and Alauddin
                Sikander Shah (Firoz Shah’s grandson).

            <p class="para-odd">
                Madrasa-e-Firoz Shahi: Established in 1352, this was a leading institution of Islamic learning in the
                Delhi Sultanate and a well-equipped Islamic seminary. This is located next to Firoz Shah’s tomb. It was
                headed by Syed Yusuf Bin Jamal Hussaini till 1388. It is a L-shaped contiguous structure with open
                pillared rooms at the top storey and small dark rooms in the lower storey with small openings for light,
                air and storage niches overlooking the reservoir that probably served as accommodation for the students.
                The exterior is covered with white plaster and painted in bright colours with golden domes.
                Mosque The mosque at the northern end of the madrasa is unlike other mosques because it has an opening,
                a window in the western wall that overlooks the tank and steps leading to the water. The prayer hall is
                open to the sky and the qibla wall from the reservoir side has five mihrabs with the central one with
                open sides.
